# AUpresetConverter

Here are set of utility to manipulate an EQ generated by REW or in APO
format.

A common user case on MacOS is that when you have done a room calibration and
you are getting some EQs generated by REW, you may have to manually
copy the EQ into AUNBandEQ. It takes 5 minutes to copy the parameters 
but it is very error prone and boring.

# How it works?

```
./rew2aupreset.py eq.txt > eq.aupreset
```

you may want to copy it where most DAW can find it:

```
cp eq.aupreset ~/Library/Audio/Presets/Apple/AUNBandEQ
```

You can then drop the eq.preset into your plugin.
