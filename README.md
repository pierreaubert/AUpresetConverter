# AUpresetConverter

Here are set of utility to manipulate an EQ generated by REW or in APO
format.

A common user case on MacOS is that when you have done a room calibration and
you are getting some EQs generated by REW, you may have to manually
copy the EQ into AUNBandEQ. It takes 5 minutes to copy the parameters
but it is very error prone and boring.

# How it works?

```
./rew2aupreset.py -i eq.txt
```

will copy the AUpreset to the standard output.

you may want to copy it where most DAW can find it:

```
./rew2aupreset.py -i eq.txt -o eq.aupreset
```

you can redirect to a file with the -o flag.

```
./rew2aupreset.py -i eq.txt -install
```

will copy the AUpreset where DAWs(1) expect to find them (2).

- (1) at least Reaper and Logic will
- (2) ~/Library/Audio/Presets/Apple/AUNBandEQ
